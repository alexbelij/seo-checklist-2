For good search rankings, make sure to add the “nofollow” attribute to external links (links to websites that you don’t own). This instructs search engines not to follow those links.

```
//bad
<a href="http://example.com">Example Website</a>

//good
<a href="http://example.com" rel="nofollow">Example Website</a>```
