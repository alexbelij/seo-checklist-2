# Contrast Ratio

For visually impaired people, it is important to have a good contrast ratio of texts, logotypes and images on a website.
Contrast Ratio can be easily checked with a Lighthouse check.

## Check

* Is text easy readable and big enough to read? Does it clearly separate itself from the background of the website?
* Is the logo well-placed? (e.g. navbar where the backgound colour supports the logotype)
