# Server side performance

Server side performance can affect SEO heavily.
A slow page increases jump rate of users and decreases the number of pages indexed by Google. It has also bad effects on rating.
Tools like Newrelic should be installed on the application and monitored to identify the slowest pages and increase performance.

## Best practice and links

- Avoid N + 1 Queries
- Follow framework and language best practices
- Server cache for frequent requests
- Remove old / duplicate code (Clean code)
